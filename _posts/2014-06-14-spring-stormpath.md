title: Using StormPath with Spring Security
description: StormPath is a User Management cloud service that provides APIs to manage users and workflows such as password reset, questions. It also provides authorization capabilities that allowed me to create a lightweight user store and delegate potentially nasty things like password management/enforcement and focus on application development.
